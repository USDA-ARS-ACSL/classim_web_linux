Call Chain

Trigger: GET /seasonalsim/seasonRun/{simulation_name} starts a background task in seasonal.py:816.
Task: Background job prepare_and_execute() (see seasonal.py:493) builds inputs and orchestrates the run.
Call site: prepare_and_execute() invokes WriteRunFile(...) here: seasonal.py:569.
Definition: WriteRunFile(cropname, soilname, field_name, cultivar, field_path, stationtype) is defined in generateModelInputFiles_helper.py:816.
Endpoints

Start IDs: POST /seasonalsim/seasonRun queues simulations and returns IDs (see seasonal.py:744).
Launch run: GET /seasonalsim/seasonRun/{simulation_name} validates operation dates, then kicks off prepare_and_execute() which calls WriteRunFile.
Stream output: GET /seasonalsim/simulationResp/{simulation_name} streams .g01 CSV updates to the UI (see seasonal.py:716).
In short: the seasonal run page hits POST /seasonalsim/seasonRun then GET /seasonalsim/seasonRun/{id}; that GET starts prepare_and_execute(), which calls WriteRunFile().
